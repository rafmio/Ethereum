Accounts
Accounts on Ethereum are either wallet addresses or smart contract addresses.
(look like 0x71c7656ec7ab88b098defb751b7401b5f6d8976f)
they're what you use for sending ETH to another user and also used for
referring to a smart contract on the blockchain when needing to interact with it

Addresses - used to receive and send transactions on the network.
An address is a string of alphanumeric characters, but cat be represented
as a scannable QR code.
They are derived from the public/private ECDSA key pair

Smart contract - contracts whose terms are recorded in a computer language
instead of legal language.
Can be executed by a computing system, sum as a suitable distributed ledger system

Ledger - an append-only record store, where records are immutable and may hold
more general information than financial records
